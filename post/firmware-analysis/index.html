Extraction gave one file output (not sure how much of it was extracted or if all of it was...). Starting to dig through the extracted file.
</code></pre><h2 id=get-a-webserver-working>Get a webserver working</h2><p>We looked through the contents of <code>/usr/www</code> to see what we could find. We weren&rsquo;t able to find much since the contents of the PHP files were unreadable. We couldn&rsquo;t figure out why, but we assumed that getting the server working would let us view it.</p><p>The challenge asked us to look for a particular function running in an embedded webserver in this device. We worked to get the webserver running so we could look around at what the system was supposed to look like. We needed to create a couple of files and directories in order for nginx to start working. Once we did that we modified the nginx configuration to allow for access from any location and allow for indexing.</p><p>We started to import some of the php files and look for which one had an <code>md_version</code> function. While we were doing that, we were also looking for other things about this system</p><h2 id=figuring-out-the-system>Figuring out the system</h2><p>We figured out that the firmware we were looking at was for a TerraMaster NAS. We&rsquo;ve had experience with TerraMaster stuff before, and knew that there has been a lot of research done on their devices. We started looking for why the PHP files were encrypted. And also looking though Ghidra tutorials to see the contents of the files. We found an <a href="https://blog.securityevaluators.com/terramaster-nas-vulnerabilities-discovered-and-exploited-b8e5243e7a63?gi=1d74ff591425" target=_blank>exploit discovery on TerraMaster devices running a custom version of PHP</a> and that looked like it what we were looking for.</p><p>It turns out, these files are AES encrypted during build time, and decrypted as part of the PHP server. It turns out the key is exactly the same as the one in the write up, and we followed the steps get decrypt all of the files. A simple find on the files led us to the <code>www/3.0/config/version.php</code> file. We cleaned up the file and submitted it.</p></article><section class="article labels"><a class=category href=/categories/iot-village-ctf/>IoT Village CTF</a><a class=tag href=/tags/terramaster/>TerraMaster</a><a class=tag href=/tags/static-analysis/>Static Analysis</a></section></div><div class="article bottom"><section class="article navigation"><p><a class=link href=/post/control4-flag-2/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Control4 Flag 2</a></p><p><a class=link href=/post/iotvillage-ctf-scan/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Iotvillage CTF Network Scan</a></p></section></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>All content is free, unencumbered, and released into the public domain.
