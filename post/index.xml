With the password we previously used, we could ssh into the ip to access the directory: /etc/init.d/c4server.
We took the MD5 sum of /etc/init.d/c4server to retrieve the flag.</description></item><item><title>Control4 Flag</title><link>/post/control4-flag/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 13:22:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/control4-flag/</guid><description>After doing some research on the control4 product, we found that there is a default root password.
