Black Box 1 Flag I noticed there was a Black Box Challenge for Control 4, which we previously exploited.
With the password we previously used, we could ssh into the ip to access the directory: /etc/init.d/c4server.
We took the MD5 sum of /etc/init.d/c4server to retrieve the flag.</description></item><item><title>Control4 Flag</title><link>/post/control4-flag/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 13:22:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/control4-flag/</guid><description>After doing some research on the control4 product, we found that there is a default root password.

Kali We set up a Vagrant machine to use as a common starting place for each of our machines. It has all of the standard Kali tools installed, as well as some other standard exploit tools.
Requirements Git Vagrant Virtualbox Package Managers It is recommended to use a package manager for installing and updating this software.</description></item><item><title>Day2 Port Scan Update</title><link>/post/day2-port-scan-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 12:16:14 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/day2-port-scan-update/</guid><description>After getting connected to the SOHOplesslyBroken VPN, we did an nmap scan of the local IP range for any devices.

See if you have the patience to scratch the itch; patience is key. Mosquitto bites are so annoying! Connect at: 209.97.159.20:1883 Creds: iot:iot
We had a feeling that this had something to do with MQTT based off the mosquitto name. Searching for port 1883 confirmed this, as this is a standard port of MQTT.
We installed the mosquitto client using:
sudo apt install -y mosquitto-clients We then connected to the server using:</description></item><item><title>Fortinet Flag</title><link>/post/fortinet-flag/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2020 23:33:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>/post/fortinet-flag/</guid><description>Finding the exploit, we did some google-fu and learned a bit about some of the exploits for the device, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t know which device on the network it was.
We connected to one of the devices and figured out that the favicon of the admin page was Fortinet&amp;rsquo;s logo. From there we started to run some of the exploits. The one that worked for us was https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43386
